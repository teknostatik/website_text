## Professional (short)

I currently work as ITIL Operations Manager, in the Service Management Operations Team at the University of Birmingham. I'm also part of the leadership team for our Agile Community of Practice, and am interested in AI, sustainability, and especially the place where the two meet.

I currently work as ITIL Operations Manager, in the Service Management Operations Team at the University of Birmingham. I'm also part of the leadership team for our Agile Community of Practice, and am interested in AI, sustainability, and especially the place where the two meet.

### About Me

I've worked at the University since October 2000, in a variety of different roles across Library Services, the IT Service Desk, New Core and Service Management. My [why](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/) is helping other people learn and improve. As well as the things I do professionally, I'm also interested in cycling, music, computer hardware and software, and sustainability. You can usually find me either sat at a computer, pedalling a bike, or when I'm working from home both at the same time. 

### Myers-Briggs / 16 Personalities

I'm an [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality), with a clear preference for all four of those letters. I think this description is very accurate:

> People with the INTJ personality type are intellectually curious individuals with a deep-seated thirst for knowledge. INTJs tend to value creative ingenuity, straightforward rationality, and self-improvement. They consistently work toward enhancing intellectual abilities and are often driven by an intense desire to master any and every topic that piques their interest.

> Logical and quick-witted, INTJs pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. Because their minds are never at rest, these personalities may sometimes struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them. But when they do find like-minded individuals who appreciate their intensity and depth of thought, INTJs form profound and intellectually stimulating relationships that they deeply treasure.

### Strengths

* I'm good at learning new things, and reaching a decent level of proficiency in a relatively short time. 
* I have a wide breadth of knowledge, with a few different depths (both technical and non-technical)
* I'm self-organising and self-sufficient
* I have good organisational knowledge, and access to a network of people across the university
* I can speak and write about my work to all different sorts of audiences

### Growth Opportunities

* I'm bad at knowing when something is finished. You can help me with this by making sure things I am working on have clear acceptance criteria.
* It can sometimes take me a while to build rapport with new people. You can help me with this by identifying people I might have to work closely with in advance so I can get to know them beforehand.
* I need time to think and reflect before making big decisions or working out what my opinion is on something. You can help me with this by providing as much information as possible in advance.

### My Working Style

* I start work early in the morning, and start to lose focus by mid-afternoon. I try and do all of my high-value work earlier in the day where possible, and book all of my focus time when other people are less likely to be working so I can be more available for my team later in the day.
* I like to start off working alone, and then start collaborating once I have a better idea of what I can contribute to something.
* I prefer informal conversations with individuals or small groups rather than big meetings.
* I am a champion of both remote and asynchronous working, but also value being able to collaborate face-to-face with my team and other people I work with regularly.

### My Availability

* I keep my calendar updated with when I am working, whether I am remote or in the office, and where possible what I am working on.
* I generally take lunch between 12-1, but often don't take the full hour so I can finish earlier. Sometimes I use this time to work on personal projects or learn new things.
* Most days I need to be done with all work-related activities (including commuting) by 5pm.
* Please try not to book online meetings when I'm in the office, or book meetings that clash with other meetings I have already committed to, as that can make diary management challenging. 
* If something is genuinely urgent then let me know and I will find time to talk about it.

### What I Assume about Others

* That you are a good person
* That you want to do your best work
* That if you need my help with something you will ask me
* That you know what your job is better than I do

## Personal (for blog, needs updating)

Things I like:

Music – I listen to music a great deal, and also write about it on this blog. I have a small group of people I talk to about music, and am always looking for new things to listen to and new people to talk to. I also started buying CDs again at the end of 2014, and signed up to Rough Trade’s album of the month vinyl subscription from 2015-23. My music habit has more recently lead to a new hobby - buying and building Ikea shelving.

Computing – I got into computing quite late, and I’m not really a proper programmer. I also currently work in IT, so my recreational computing pursuits sometimes have to take a back seat to give me some chance of a decent work/life balance. That said, I still do blog about computers a fair bit, and I'm interested in web technology (especially WordPress and various social media channels), and anything to do with making computers work more like people and people work more like computers. I’ve also done a lot of work with free and open source software in the past, and still dabble on occasion, but I now largely use computers for writing and hunting down new music, books and knowledge in general.

Keyboards - I build and customise ortholinear and/or split mechanical keyboards, and also customise the firmware that controls them.

Sustainability and environmental concerns – I have a degree in Environmental Science, and am a great believer that as custodians of our planet we have a responsibility to keep it healthy for as long as possible. I champion green issues at work, and generally have a number of projects on the go that tap into these ideas. I became vegetarian in 2017, and started using a bike as my main form of transport in 2018. I think I could still probably do more though.

People – I am interested in people, and how they work. I’m a classic INTJ in that respect (and in a lot of other respects actually), and I spend a great deal of time talking to people who interest me. I will go out of my way to track down people who I think can contribute something positive to my life, and one of my projects for 2013 was to spend more time talking about things that matter with people who matter. My project for 2014 was to gain qualification/certification as a MBTI (Myers-Briggs type indicator) practitioner, and I’m now working out ways to use the tool in my personal and professional environments.
